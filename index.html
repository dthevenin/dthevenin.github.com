      <h2>Mobile, Web, and UI technologies promoter<br />
      <small>Started my carrier as researcher in Humman Computer Interaction. My main interests are in UI adaptability and mobile computing. <br />
      Now I'm promoting WEB technologies in oder to help cross device development, UI adaptation and live coding/testing.</small></h2>

      <div class="intro">
        <p>
        I use the cross-platform technologies promoted by the W3C to develop highly interective applications, that can run on any kind of devices. <br />
        Then I implemented or experimented solutions such as <a href="vs_toolkit.html">VS-Toolkit</a> [2009-2014], <a href="gl_ui.html">GL Engine</a> [2014-2015] or the <a href="animated_transition.html">Animated transitions</a> [2015]. 
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
        In an other hand I'm exploring how we can make easier the collaboration between the designer, the developer and the tester. <br />
        For that purpose I've developed the software <a href="https://www.vinisketch.com">ViniSketch Designer</a> - 2009-2015. I also developed technologies for live design and coding to reduce the gap between coding and testing into a real device. <br /> I've also investigated the DAG formalism in order to express data dependencies into a software. As result I've implemented into the VSToolkit an one way dataflow, compiler and optimizer. <br />This toolkit has been a big optunity to implements concepts such as:
        <ul style="padding-left:50px">
          <li>Mainloop, events ordering, messages
          <li>Task scheduling (PAR and SEQ)
          <li>Dataflow with optimisation, ordering and cycle detection
          <li>OOP with JavaScript
        </ul>
